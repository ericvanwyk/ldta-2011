\section{Silver, an extensible attribute grammar system}

\subsection{Introduction of Silver}

\subsection{Scanning and parsing}

Silver uses Copper~\cite{vanwyk07gpce,schwerdfeger09pldi} for
scanning and parsing.

\subsection{Name analysis - 1/2 page}

Silver uses higher-order and reference~\cite{hedin00informatica}.

We will eventually want to consolodate shared references, so if Gorel
happens to include her 2000 Informatica paper in her bib file, we would want
to use that.  (Or she may prefer we cite something else entirely.)
